# PARKING SLOT DETECTION
Finding a vaccant spot in a parking  lot is a tough ask. It is even difficult to manage such facilites with a varying incoming traffic. Which slots are vaccant at this instant? What time do we need more slots. Are commuters finding it difficult to reach to a particular slot?

We corrently use either a network of ground mounted occupancy sensor or a large staff to determine some of the answers to these questions. Sensors are quite effective but need maintainence and cost about 40 -80$ per node in unit + installation. A staff only sollution is cumbersome and error prone

One approch to the problem can be using the security camera footage to detect the slot occupancy using deep learning. While there are limitations (clear visibility trees shade , lighting) the approach can be extended to some lots atr a very minimal costs.
The code tries to address some these problems.

## DOWNLOAD THE IMAGES [CNRPARK Dataset]
You can use any video feed. For the purpose of demonstration we will use Feed from CNRPARK dataset (https://cnrpark.it).  It has roughly 150,000 labeled images (patches) of vacant and occupied parking spaces, built on a parking lot of 164 parking spaces.

Frames chopped from 9 security cameras placed along CNRPARM in different climatic condition and lighting

## DOWNLOAD PRETRAINED MODEL WEIGHTS

I have used both maskrcnn and yolo. Maskrcnn unsuprisingly detects finer objects in the corners while yolo misses out on a few slots even after it has been specialized to detect only car classes. 

###YOLO

`! wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
! python ./convert.py ./yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights model_data/yolo.h5`


###MASKRCNN
